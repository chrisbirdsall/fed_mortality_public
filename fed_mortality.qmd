## Introduction

-   **Motivation**:
    -   "Doing good is good for you!"
    -   So, is public service good for longevity?
    -   ...probably depends on who you are and what kind of job you have

## Introduction

-   **Research Questions**:
    -   How do mortality patterns differ among federal employees?
    -   Which factors are associated with survival differences?

## Previous Research

-   Surprisingly scant research on occupation/job-related characteristics and mortality
-   Public service motivation research suggests association between public service and job satisfaction
-   Activating PSM in public service setting often depending on job content and perceived connection to advancing the public good

## Data and Methods

-   **Data Source**: 40 years (1973-2013) of OPM's Central Personnel Data File (CPDF) via FOIA

-   **Method**: Survival Analysis - Time-varying Cox Proportional Hazards Model

## Key Variables

-   D**emographics:** age, veteran status, minority status, education, sex (forthcoming)
-   J**ob characteristics:** salary, supervisory status, occupation category
-   **Time-varying events:** performance awards, stressful events (furloughs, suspensions)
-   **Death events**

## Limitations and Future Directions

-   **Limitations**:
    -   Right censoring (don't know what happens after employees retire)
    -   Departures other than retirement and death are omitted
    -   No private sector comparison
-   **Future Directions**:
    -   Do effects vary by agency?
    -   Further investigation of occupational differences
    -   What's going on with stress events? (furloughs and suspensions)
    -   Private sector comparison
